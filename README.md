# Bourre-Legacy-Winery
Web Programming Content Management System project (YR 2, SEM 1) 

There is no source code for this project; a CMS was used to create the entire site, and no custom code was added.

The PDF includes a brief description of the CMS used (Wix) and why it was chosen for this project, and a comparison of using a CMS for website creation versus doing so from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

A business description is also provided, the history and inspiration, vision and mission statements, logo and colour justification and intended audience are discussed in brief detail. A complete brand package wasn't created since that was not the main focus of the project, but just enough was done to give adequate creative direction. 

A link to the PDF is in the document, but here it is for quicker access as well: https://iyanataylor313.wixsite.com/bourre-legacy-winery
